# 20240101

Worked on the imagine-bot and, specifically, the `/imagine` slash command. The basic goal is just to do what midjourney does (though with a single image for now).

Next steps would be
- multi-image with selection of next steps
- save all to airtable
- use other bots for ongoing storytelling.

New bots imagined?

- detective-bot
